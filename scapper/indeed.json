Healing made personal.\nConsumer Digital - Req # 2662850\n\nJunior Full Stack Software Engineer\n\nCOMPANY OVERVIEW\nMount Sinai Health System is accelerating a transition to a business and operating model oriented towards the changing demands of the healthcare industry. Success in this new model will require, among other things, an expanded focus on the consumer. Traditionally, the focus of consumer engagement was limited to their role as patients and associated primarily with the services rendered in our hospitals and physician offices. In the new model, Mount Sinai will need to engage consumers, their families, and caregivers throughout the health care life cycle, i.e. when they shop for and buy health care, when they are trying to stay well, and when they need care. Beyond the hospital and the doctor\u2019s office, we will engage them at home, at work, and in the community. We must engage with them when and how they want to be engaged. This will require Mount Sinai to \u201cproductize\u201d these points of engagement with consumers. It will require new leaders with core competencies in the areas of software engineering, big data, behavioral economics, person-centered design, and rapid iteration development and experimentation, all of which are more frequently and effectively practiced outside the healthcare industry today. Our charter is to productize solutions using the latest and greatest technologies, operating like a startup, but leveraging a strong bias for action, clinical expertise, and robust funding from the broader Mount Sinai ecosystem.\n\nPOSITION OVERVIEW\nAs a Junior Full Stack Software Engineer you will get to work on a high-caliber team within one of the top health systems in the world. To drive this expanded focus on the consumer, the Mount Sinai Health System is launching a new Consumer Digital Solutions team, as an affiliate of the Population Health division, Mount Sinai Health Partners (MSHP). The Junior Full Stack Software Engineer will be responsible for building consumer-grade experiences using the latest mobile and web technologies and design considerations, and building and hooking up to modern APIs and data sources. You will report directly to the CTO and collaborate with the Product Strategy team, as well as clinical, operational, and sales leads within the health system to develop integrated solutions. The ultimate goal is to deliver real-world, modern products that help patients with access, navigation, service, payments, and overall clinical outcomes. The long-term vision for the team is to scale this platform across the enterprise and potentially \u2018spin out\u2019 to develop products for and with other health systems.\nSCOPE OF RESPONSIBILITIES\nTeam Collaboration: Work with Product Management and UX/UI designers, turning mockups into beautiful, consumer- grade experiences. Attend daily standups and communicate with engineering manager and product managers.\nDomain Knowledge: Follow the market and the latest and greatest technologies being used to engage consumers and build great products. Know the relevant libraries and frameworks and be able to differentiate \u2018hype\u2019 from \u2018game changer.\u2019\nTechnical Skills: Have strong command of a programming language on front end and back end, as well as ability to learn new technologies quickly by prototyping and digging in.\nProduct Development: Build mobile-first web and native applications in an agile environment. Be able to provide estimates and deliver high-quality output on-time and in-budget.\n\n\nCANDIDATE QUALIFICATIONS\nEngineering Professional: We are looking for a junior software engineer with 1 to 3 years of experience as a junior full stack software engineer. We want someone with consumer experience where real customers and external users used the products you developed, and those products then scaled up in terms of volume of transactions, interactions, features, etc. A Computer Science or equivalent college degree is required.
